Project Insights: 

● Developed an online system for the university on-campus students in which students can vote for a specific meal (given 4-5
options by the Food manager) they want to eat on a specific day in the future.

● The system is really useful to both the parties as the food manager can estimate which ingredients he should buy and of what
quantity to make a future meal based on the votes he got from students and Students can satisfy their meal wishes.

● The system allows the students to give feedback about the meal they had eaten based on various factors such as Taste, Quality,
Service, Hygiene, and Cleanliness.
